# Web Application - User Guide

## How to Run the Web Application

1. First, open `home.html` to access the homepage.
2. Create a new account by registering your login credentials.
3. Once registered, use the login page to access the web application's features.

### Notes:
- Ensure the server is running and the application is properly deployed before accessing `home.html`.
- You may need to configure a local server like Tomcat if using JSP pages.
